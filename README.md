# Udacity: Identify Customer Segments

This is a project completed for Udacity's Machine Learning: Introduction nanodegree. It applies the unsupervised learning algorithm K-Means clustering to identify the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. In a real-life setting, the results could be used for advertising campaigns targeting specific segments of the population. Data (not included in repo) was provided by Udacity's partner Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics.
